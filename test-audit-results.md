| `renders as anchor when href is provided` | The RetroButton component doesn't support href prop | [RetroButton.test.tsx:24-29](app/components/shared/RetroButton.test.tsx:24-29) | The component renders only an HTML button, not an anchor |
| `applies type="button" by default` | The RetroButton doesn't set a default type attribute | [RetroButton.test.tsx:151-155](app/components/shared/RetroButton.test.tsx:151-155) | No default type is set on the button element |
| `has correct disabled styles` | The component doesn't have specific disabled styles | [RetroButton.test.tsx:181-186](app/components/shared/RetroButton.test.tsx:181-186) | No special styles are added for the disabled state |

|------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| `applies absolute positioning` | The component doesn't apply absolute positioning | [StarDecoration.test.tsx:67-71](app/components/shared/StarDecoration.test.tsx:67-71) | No absolute positioning classes are added to the component |
| `accepts aria-hidden as an override (should still be true)` | This test is not applicable since the component always sets aria-hidden | [StarDecoration.test.tsx:89-95](app/components/shared/StarDecoration.test.tsx:89-95) | The component explicitly sets aria-hidden="true" |

### 2.4. TexturedCard.test.tsx (4 skipped tests)

| Test Description | Reason Skipped | File:Line | Relevant Component Code |
|------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| `renders with article element` | The component renders a div, not an article | [TexturedCard.test.tsx:31-39](app/components/shared/TexturedCard.test.tsx:31-39) | The component renders a div as the root element |
| `accepts and applies ARIA attributes` | TypeScript doesn't allow ARIA attributes on this component | [TexturedCard.test.tsx:55-63](app/components/shared/TexturedCard.test.tsx:55-63) | The component's props interface doesn't include ARIA attributes |
| `has hover effect` | The component doesn't have hover effects | [TexturedCard.test.tsx:91-99](app/components/shared/TexturedCard.test.tsx:91-99) | No hover effect classes are added |
| `passes through additional props` | The component doesn't pass through additional props | [TexturedCard.test.tsx:115-123](app/components/shared/TexturedCard.test.tsx:115-123) | The component only spreads className prop |

## 3. E2E Tests

The project uses Playwright for E2E testing. All E2E tests are currently failing with the same error:

**Error Message:**
> Playwright Test did not expect test.describe() to be called here.
> Most common reasons include:
> - You are calling test.describe() in a configuration file.
> - You are calling test.describe() in a file that is imported by the configuration file.
> - You have two different versions of @playwright/test. This usually happens when one of the dependencies in your package.json depends on @playwright/test.

### 3.1. Failing E2E Test Files

1. **accessibility.test.ts** - 5 tests failing
2. **links.test.ts** - 2 tests failing
3. **navigation.test.ts** - 2 tests failing
4. **responsive.test.ts** - 3 tests failing

The cause of these failures appears to be a configuration issue with Playwright and how it's integrated with Vitest. It could be a conflict between test runners.

## 4. Summary of Issues to Address

### 4.1. Component Tests

1. **ExternalLink Component:**
   - Missing functionality for overriding security attributes (target, rel)
   - Doesn't pass through additional props

2. **RetroButton Component:**
   - Doesn't support href prop for link functionality
   - Doesn't set default button type
   - Missing disabled styles
   - Entire "Link Mode" functionality is missing

3. **StarDecoration Component:**
   - Doesn't support absolute positioning
   - Doesn't accept aria-hidden override (by design)

4. **TexturedCard Component:**
   - Renders div instead of article (semantic HTML issue)
   - Doesn't accept ARIA attributes
   - Missing hover effects
   - Doesn't pass through additional props

### 4.2. E2E Tests

All E2E tests are failing due to a configuration issue with Playwright. This likely requires:
1. Resolving the conflict between test runners
2. Updating the configuration to properly integrate Playwright with the project's test setup

## 5. Recommendations

1. **For Component Tests:**
   - Evaluate whether the skipped tests represent desired functionality that should be implemented
   - Update the component implementations to support missing features
   - Or update tests to align with the current design decisions

2. **For E2E Tests:**
   - Investigate and fix the Playwright configuration issue
   - Consider separating the E2E test command from the component test command to avoid conflicts
