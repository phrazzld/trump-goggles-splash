# T013 Implementation Plan

## Task: implement/update e2e tests for hero animation smoothness and accessibility

### Approach

This task extends our existing Playwright E2E test suite to cover hero animations and accessibility compliance. Building on patterns established in T012 (visual regression tests), I will create focused tests that verify:

1. **Animation Completion**: Basic animation flow without errors (not complex performance analysis)
2. **Accessibility Compliance**: ARIA labels, reduced motion behavior

### Implementation Strategy

**File**: Create `e2e/hero-animation-accessibility.e2e.ts`

**Test Categories**:
1. **Animation Smoothness Tests**: Verify animations complete without JavaScript errors or console warnings
2. **Accessibility Tests**: Verify ARIA attributes, reduced motion compliance, keyboard navigation

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Follow established patterns from `e2e/hero-visual.e2e.ts` for consistency
- Focus on error detection rather than performance measurement (per acceptance criteria)
- Use Playwright's built-in accessibility testing capabilities
- Test both normal and reduced motion scenarios
- Scope tests to hero section specifically to avoid flakiness

### Adherence to Development Philosophy

- **Simplicity**: Straightforward test implementation using established patterns
- **Testability**: E2E tests verify behavior via public interface (DOM)
- **Explicit**: Clear test descriptions and assertion messages
- **Mock Policy**: No internal mocking - testing real browser behavior with external system (page)

### Success Criteria

1. Tests verify basic animation completion without errors
2. Tests validate ARIA labels and accessibility compliance
3. Tests confirm prefers-reduced-motion behavior
4. All tests pass consistently
5. Tests follow project E2E patterns and standards
