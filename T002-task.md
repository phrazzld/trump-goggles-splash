## Title
simplify hero component animation sequence

## Original Ticket Text
**T002 · Refactor · P0: simplify hero component animation sequence**
- **Context:** PLAN.md > Detailed Implementation Plan > Phase 1: Animation Smoothing > 1.2 Simplify Hero Animation Sequence
- **Code Area:** `app/components/Hero.tsx`
- **Action:**
    1. Audit existing Framer Motion animation sequences within the Hero component.
    2. Remove or refactor overlapping/competing motion transitions to create a single, coordinated animation timeline for all hero elements (e.g., text, CTAs).
- **Done‑when:**
    1. Hero elements animate in a clear, coordinated sequence without visual conflicts or jank.
    2. Overall motion complexity is reduced while maintaining visual impact.
- **Verification:**
    1. Observe the full hero animation sequence on page load; ensure all elements animate cohesively.
    2. Check for any visual glitches or elements animating out of sync.
- **Depends‑on:** [T001]

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

This is a complex refactoring task requiring careful analysis of existing animation sequences and design decisions about coordination. The goal is to simplify while maintaining visual impact and ensuring smooth, cohesive animations.

Key considerations:
1. **Animation Audit**: Identify all current Framer Motion sequences in Hero.tsx
2. **Conflict Analysis**: Determine which animations compete or overlap visually
3. **Coordination Strategy**: Design a unified timeline that maintains visual hierarchy
4. **Performance Impact**: Ensure simplification improves rather than degrades performance
5. **Accessibility**: Maintain reduced motion support throughout refactoring
6. **Visual Impact**: Preserve the intended retro Americana aesthetic and user engagement

The approach must follow development philosophy principles of simplicity first while ensuring the solution is maintainable and testable.
