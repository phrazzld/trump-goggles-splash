# Title: Add Entrance Animations

# Original Ticket Text:
- [ ] **T010 · Feature · P1: Add Entrance Animations**
    - Implement subtle Framer Motion animations
    - Ensure all animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
    - Add StarDecoration elements throughout sections
    - **Done-when:** Sections animate smoothly on scroll/load
    - **Depends-on:** [T009]

# Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt:

You are tasked with implementing entrance animations for a Next.js splash page using Framer Motion. The page has multiple sections that should animate on scroll/load.

Context:
- This is a Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
- The site has a retro Americana theme (red, blue, cream, gold, black)
- Sections include: Hero, FeatureShowcase, TrumpismExamples, InstallationGuide, Footer
- StarDecoration components are already available and used in some sections
- Must respect user's motion preferences (prefers-reduced-motion)
- Animations should be subtle and enhance, not distract

Requirements:
1. Install and configure Framer Motion
2. Add subtle entrance animations to each section
3. Ensure animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
4. Add more StarDecoration elements as accent pieces
5. Use scroll-triggered animations where appropriate
6. Keep animations performant (60fps)

Consider:
- Which animation patterns work best for each section type
- How to maintain consistency across animations
- Performance implications of animations
- Accessibility requirements
- Best practices for Framer Motion with Next.js

Provide a detailed implementation plan covering:
1. Framer Motion setup and configuration
2. Animation patterns for each section
3. Scroll trigger implementation
4. Motion preference handling
5. StarDecoration placement strategy
6. Performance considerations
7. Testing approach
