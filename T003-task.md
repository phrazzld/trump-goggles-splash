## Title
optimize hero animation performance with css properties

## Original Ticket Text
**T003 · Refactor · P0: optimize hero animation performance with css properties**
- **Context:** PLAN.md > Detailed Implementation Plan > Phase 1: Animation Smoothing > 1.3 Optimize Animation Performance
- **Code Area:** `app/components/Hero.tsx`, `app/components/shared/AnimatedStar.tsx`, relevant CSS/Tailwind utility classes
- **Action:**
    1. Apply the `will-change` CSS property (e.g., `will-change: transform, opacity;`) to elements in `Hero.tsx` and `AnimatedStar.tsx` that are being animated.
    2. Review and consolidate multiple CSS transform operations into a single `transform` property where applicable to enhance GPU acceleration.
- **Done‑when:**
    1. `will-change` CSS property is correctly applied to key animated elements.
    2. CSS transform operations are consolidated for optimal rendering.
    3. Animations demonstrate smoother rendering and leverage GPU acceleration.
- **Verification:**
    1. Use browser DevTools (e.g., Layers panel, Performance monitor) to confirm `will-change` is active and elements are composited on the GPU during animations.
    2. Profile animations to ensure smooth frame rates (aiming for 60fps).
- **Depends‑on:** [T002]

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

This is a performance optimization task focused on leveraging GPU acceleration for animations. The goal is to apply CSS optimization techniques that will enhance rendering performance without changing visual behavior.

Key considerations:
1. **Performance Analysis**: Identify which elements are being animated and need optimization
2. **will-change Property**: Apply judiciously only to elements that actually animate
3. **Transform Consolidation**: Find and merge multiple transform operations
4. **GPU Acceleration**: Ensure proper layer creation for compositing
5. **Performance Testing**: Verify improvements via DevTools profiling
6. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure optimizations work across browsers
7. **Memory Impact**: Avoid excessive GPU memory usage

The approach must follow development philosophy principles, particularly "Maintainability Over Premature Optimization" - only optimize where measurable benefits exist.
