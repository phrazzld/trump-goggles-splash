## Title
optimize hero background patterns for performance and hierarchy

## Original Ticket Text
```
- [~] **T007 · Refactor · P1: optimize hero background patterns for performance and hierarchy**
    - **Context:** PLAN.md > Detailed Implementation Plan > Phase 3: Visual Polish > 3.1 Background Pattern Optimization
    - **Code Area:** CSS/Styling for hero background patterns (likely in `app/components/Hero.tsx` or related global/component CSS)
    - **Action:**
        1. Review existing layered CSS background patterns; consolidate them where possible to reduce rendering complexity (e.g., fewer layers, optimized images).
        2. Optimize any texture images or complex CSS patterns used for file size and rendering performance.
        3. Ensure the optimized background maintains or improves visual hierarchy and the intended retro Americana aesthetic.
    - **Done‑when:**
        1. Hero background patterns are simplified or consolidated for better performance.
        2. Texture patterns (if any) are optimized.
        3. Visual hierarchy and design intent are preserved or enhanced.
    - **Verification:**
        1. Visually inspect the hero background on various devices for intended appearance and quality.
        2. Check page load performance (e.g., Lighthouse, WebPageTest) and browser rendering performance (DevTools) for any improvements or regressions.
    - **Depends‑on:** [T004]

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

Analyze this task deeply and create a comprehensive implementation plan. Consider:

1. **Current State Analysis:**
   - What background patterns/layers currently exist?
   - How are they implemented (CSS gradients, images, pseudo-elements)?
   - What is their rendering cost?
   - How do they contribute to visual hierarchy?

2. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Which patterns/layers have the highest rendering cost?
   - Can multiple layers be consolidated into fewer?
   - Are there GPU-friendly alternatives?
   - What is the impact on paint/composite operations?

3. **Visual Design Preservation:**
   - How to maintain the retro Americana aesthetic?
   - Which visual elements are critical for hierarchy?
   - What is the minimum viable pattern complexity?

4. **Technical Implementation:**
   - Should patterns be CSS-only or use optimized images?
   - How to leverage CSS containment/will-change?
   - Browser compatibility requirements?
   - Mobile performance considerations?

5. **Testing Strategy:**
   - How to measure rendering performance objectively?
   - Visual regression testing approach?
   - Performance benchmarking methodology?
   - Cross-device testing requirements?

6. **Risk Mitigation:**
   - How to ensure no visual regression?
   - Fallback strategies for older browsers?
   - Progressive enhancement approach?

Create a detailed, actionable plan that balances performance optimization with visual design integrity.
