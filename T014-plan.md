# T014 Implementation Plan

## Task: conduct performance tests for hero animations

### Approach

This task focuses on establishing performance baselines and monitoring for hero animations using established performance testing tools. The approach will be pragmatic, leveraging existing tools while providing actionable metrics.

### Implementation Strategy

**Primary Tools**:
1. **Lighthouse**: For Core Web Vitals and general performance metrics
2. **Playwright Performance API**: For frame rate monitoring and timing measurements
3. **Browser DevTools Protocol**: For detailed animation performance analysis

**Test Categories**:
1. **Baseline Establishment**: Document current performance before/after animation changes
2. **Frame Rate Testing**: Verify 60fps target for smooth animations
3. **Core Web Vitals**: Monitor LCP, CLS impact from animations
4. **Memory Usage**: Check for animation-related memory leaks

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Use Playwright's existing infrastructure for consistency with E2E tests
- Focus on measurable metrics rather than subjective assessments
- Create reusable performance testing utilities
- Document results in a clear, actionable format

### Implementation Plan

**File Structure**:
- Create `scripts/performance-test.js` for performance testing script
- Create `e2e/hero-performance.e2e.ts` for automated performance E2E tests
- Create `docs/PERFORMANCE-BASELINE.md` for results documentation

**Testing Strategy**:
1. Measure baseline performance with animations disabled
2. Measure performance with normal animations
3. Measure performance with reduced motion preference
4. Compare results and document findings

### Adherence to Development Philosophy

- **Simplicity**: Use established tools and straightforward metrics
- **Automate**: Create automated performance tests that can be run regularly  
- **Explicit**: Clear performance thresholds and actionable reporting
- **Document**: Record baseline and ongoing performance measurements

### Success Criteria

1. Performance baseline established and documented
2. Animation frame rates achieve/maintain 60fps target
3. No significant Core Web Vitals degradation observed
4. Automated performance testing integrated into project
5. Clear documentation of performance testing approach and results
