# T016 Implementation Plan

## Task: update component documentation for Hero and AnimatedStar

### Approach

Review changes from T001-T008 and update documentation to reflect the current state of Hero and AnimatedStar components. Focus on documenting the *why* behind animation decisions and behavior changes.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Review Prior Changes**:
   - T001: AnimatedStar - predictable delays, smooth transitions
   - T002: Hero - simplified animation sequence
   - T003: Performance optimizations with will-change
   - T004-T006: Layout improvements and responsiveness
   - T007-T008: Visual polish and typography refinements

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Add/update JSDoc comments focusing on:
     - Animation behavior and timing rationale
     - Accessibility considerations (reduced motion)
     - Performance optimizations applied
     - Responsive design decisions
   - Check for existing Storybook stories and update if present

3. **Key Documentation Points**:
   - AnimatedStar: Document delay prop, reduced motion handling, performance optimizations
   - Hero: Document coordinated animation sequence, responsive layout, accessibility features

### Adherence to Development Philosophy

- **Document the Why**: Focus on rationale for animation timing, performance choices, accessibility decisions
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't document what the code clearly shows (e.g., prop types)
- **Clarity**: Use clear, concise language that helps developers understand design decisions

### Success Criteria

1. JSDoc/TSDoc comments accurately reflect current component behavior
2. Documentation explains design decisions and trade-offs
3. Any existing Storybook stories are updated
4. Documentation is helpful for future developers
