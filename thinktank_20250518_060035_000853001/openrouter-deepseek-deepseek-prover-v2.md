## Chosen Approach
Implement a typography overhaul using `next/font` with Playfair Display Black for headings, Impact for CTAs, and Inter for body text, configured in `tailwind.config.ts` and applied globally with semantic font names and responsive design.

## Rationale
- **Simplicity**: Uses `next/font` for optimized loading and easy integration with Tailwind CSS.
- **Modularity**: Fonts are configured in `tailwind.config.ts` with semantic names for easy maintenance and updates.
- **Testability**: Ensures fonts render correctly across breakpoints without layout shifts, verified through visual regression testing.
- **Coding Standards**: Adheres to TypeScript strict mode and follows frontend development philosophy.
- **Docs Approach**: Self-documenting code with minimal comments, relying on clear naming and structure.

## Build Steps
1. **Select and Import Fonts**:
   - Use `next/font` to import Playfair Display Black, Impact, and Inter with appropriate subsets and weights.
   - Define CSS variables for each font family in `globals.css`.

2. **Configure `tailwind.config.ts`**:
   - Extend the `fontFamily` theme to include the new fonts with semantic names (`display`, `body`, `accent`).

3. **Apply Fonts Globally**:
   - In `layout.tsx`, apply the `font-body` class to the `<body>` element for the base font.
   - Use `font-display` and `font-accent` classes for headings and CTAs respectively in the relevant components.

4. **Ensure Responsiveness**:
   - Test fonts across all breakpoints to ensure no layout shifts occur.
   - Use Tailwind's responsive design utilities to adjust font sizes and line heights as needed.

5. **Validate and Test**:
   - Perform visual regression testing to confirm correct font rendering.
   - Check for accessibility and performance metrics to ensure compliance with standards.
