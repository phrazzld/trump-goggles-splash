refine hero typography and spacing for responsive visual rhythm

## Original Ticket Text
```
- [~] **T008 · Refactor · P1: refine hero typography and spacing for responsive visual rhythm**
    - **Context:** PLAN.md > Detailed Implementation Plan > Phase 3: Visual Polish > 3.2 Typography and Spacing Refinement
    - **Code Area:** `app/components/Hero.tsx` and its child elements containing text and layout structure; relevant Tailwind CSS configuration or global styles.
    - **Action:**
        1. Verify that all text elements (headings, paragraphs, CTAs) within the hero section scale responsively and appropriately across defined breakpoints.
        2. Review and adjust spacing (margins, paddings) between hero elements to optimize visual rhythm, balance, and hierarchy.
    - **Done‑when:**
        1. Typography scales correctly and maintains legibility on all common devices.
        2. Spacing relationships between elements are balanced and contribute to a clear visual hierarchy.
        3. The overall visual polish of typography and spacing is enhanced, consistent with the retro Americana design.
    - **Verification:**
        1. Visually inspect typography (font sizes, line heights, weights) and spacing on multiple devices/breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).
        2. Compare against design specifications if available, or assess for improved visual harmony and readability.
    - **Depends‑on:** none

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

Analyze this task deeply and create a comprehensive implementation plan. Consider:

1. **Current Typography State Analysis:**
   - What typography scales are currently defined in globals.css?
   - How do headings, paragraphs, and CTAs scale across breakpoints?
   - Are there any gaps or inconsistencies in the current scaling?
   - What font families and weights are being used?

2. **Spacing and Visual Rhythm Assessment:**
   - What spacing patterns exist between hero elements?
   - Are margins and paddings consistent with design principles?
   - How does spacing scale across different viewports?
   - Is there a clear visual hierarchy through spacing?

3. **Retro Americana Design Consistency:**
   - How to enhance typography while maintaining the retro aesthetic?
   - What spacing patterns reinforce the vintage feel?
   - How to balance modern responsiveness with vintage charm?

4. **Responsive Design Considerations:**
   - What breakpoints need special attention?
   - How should typography and spacing adapt for mobile vs desktop?
   - Are there any accessibility considerations for font sizes?

5. **Technical Implementation:**
   - Should changes be made via Tailwind utilities or custom CSS?
   - How to maintain consistency with the global design system?
   - What CSS properties need attention (line-height, letter-spacing, etc.)?

6. **Testing Strategy:**
   - How to verify typography scales appropriately?
   - Visual regression testing approach?
   - Accessibility testing for text contrast and size?
   - Cross-device testing methodology?

Create a detailed plan that enhances visual polish while maintaining design consistency and accessibility.
