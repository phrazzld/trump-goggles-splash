## Original Ticket Text
### T009 - Unit Tests for Config Integration ðŸ§ª
- **Priority**: P0 - Testing gap
- **Status**: [~] In Progress
- **Dependencies**: T004, T005, T006
- **Files**: Create tests for affected components
- **Task**: Test configuration usage in components
- **Tests**:
  - Components use config values
  - Type safety is maintained
  - No hardcoded strings remain
  - Config changes reflect in components
- **Done When**:
  - Test files created for each component
  - All tests pass
  - Coverage maintained

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt
Create comprehensive unit tests for components that were updated in T004, T005, and T006 to use externalized configuration. The tests should verify:

1. Components correctly read and use values from APP_CONFIG
2. Type safety is maintained when accessing config
3. No hardcoded strings remain in components
4. Changes to config values are reflected in component rendering
5. Components handle edge cases gracefully

Components affected:
- TrumpismExamples (T004)
- InstallationGuide (T005)
- Hero (T006)

Follow TDD principles and ensure high test coverage while maintaining test clarity and maintainability.
