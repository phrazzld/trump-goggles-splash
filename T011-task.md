# T011 Task

**Task ID:** T011
**Title:** Accessibility & Responsive Design

## Original Ticket Text

- [ ] **T011 · Feature · P0: Accessibility & Responsive Design**
    - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
    - Test keyboard navigation and focus states
    - Verify responsive layout at all breakpoints (mobile → desktop)
    - **Done-when:** Page is fully accessible and responsive
    - **Depends-on:** [T009]

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

As an AI coding agent tasked with implementing this feature, analyze the following requirements and create a comprehensive implementation plan:

### Context
- This is a Trump Goggles Chrome Extension splash page using Next.js 15
- The project follows strict development philosophy with emphasis on simplicity, modularity, and testability
- Using Tailwind CSS v4 for styling with retro Americana theme
- Framer Motion used for animations (T010 just completed)
- Atomic Design principles with shared components
- Strict pnpm enforcement

### Current State
- All sections are implemented with Framer Motion animations
- Components use "use client" directives for Next.js 15 compatibility
- Responsive design not yet fully verified
- Accessibility features not systematically implemented
- No keyboard navigation testing done

### Requirements Analysis
1. Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components
2. Test and fix keyboard navigation and focus states
3. Verify responsive layout at all breakpoints (mobile → desktop)
4. Ensure animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
5. Add proper ARIA labels and roles where needed
6. Check color contrast meets accessibility standards
7. Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible

### Technical Considerations
- Tailwind breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px), 2xl (1536px)
- Components must work with screen readers
- Focus indicators must be visible and clear
- All images need proper alt text
- Links need descriptive text for screen readers
- Animations already respect reduced motion preference

### Implementation Approach
Create a systematic approach to:
1. Audit current accessibility status
2. Implement missing ARIA attributes and roles
3. Fix keyboard navigation issues
4. Add proper focus indicators
5. Verify responsive layout at all breakpoints
6. Test with screen readers
7. Validate WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

Consider creating utility components or hooks if patterns emerge that need reuse.
