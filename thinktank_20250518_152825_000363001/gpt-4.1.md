## Chosen Approach
Encapsulate section entrance animations using a reusable Framer Motion Section wrapper that handles scroll triggers and reduced motion, with section-level animation patterns and enhanced StarDecoration placement.

## Rationale
- Enforces simplicity by centralizing animation logic in a single wrapper, avoiding repetitive per-section code and reducing accidental complexity.
- Maximizes modularity and strict separation: each section imports the same Section wrapper for motion logic; animation variants are composable and typed.
- Testability is improved: animation logic is unit-testable in isolation, and per-section stories can demonstrate motion and reduced-motion in Storybook.
- Strict adherence to coding standards: TypeScript types, no `any`, explicit motion props, and atomic organization.
- Documentation is focused: the Section wrapper and animation variants are documented in Storybook and code comments, clarifying the "why" and "how" per philosophy.

## Build Steps
1. **Install and configure Framer Motion:**
   - Add `framer-motion` to dependencies; ensure correct setup for Next.js 15 and SSR.
   - Optionally create a `framer-motion.config.ts` for shared transition defaults.
2. **Implement a reusable `<AnimatedSection>` component:**
   - Wraps children in a Framer Motion `motion.section`.
   - Accepts props for animation variant (e.g., fade, slide-up, stagger), optional custom overrides.
   - Uses `useInView` (with Intersection Observer) for scroll-triggered entrance.
   - Automatically checks `prefers-reduced-motion` (via `useReducedMotion` hook from Framer Motion) and disables or simplifies animation if enabled.
   - Ensures `aria-hidden` and a11y props are respected; does not break keyboard navigation or screen reader flow.
3. **Replace each top-level section in the splash page (`Hero`, `FeatureShowcase`, `TrumpismExamples`, `InstallationGuide`, `Footer`) with `<AnimatedSection>`:**
   - Choose entrance variant per section (e.g., Hero: fade-in-up, FeatureShowcase: staggered fade, Examples: cards fade/slide, Footer: subtle fade).
   - For content with multiple child elements (e.g., grid items), use Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence` and child variants for staggered or cascade effects.
4. **Review and add StarDecoration elements:**
   - Audit each section for visual balance; add or adjust StarDecoration placements for thematic accent, ensuring they do not overlap with animated content.
   - Where appropriate, animate StarDecorations' opacity or entrance for subtle visual enhancement, but disable such effects when reduced motion is preferred.
5. **Performance and accessibility tuning:**
   - Use simple transforms and opacity (avoid expensive filters or layout shifts).
   - Set appropriate transition durations (150â€“300ms) and delays for subtlety.
   - Test on low-end devices and with DevTools throttling to ensure 60fps.
   - Validate that no animation blocks user input or causes layout shifts (CLS).
6. **Testing:**
   - Add Storybook stories for `<AnimatedSection>` with all variants and reduced motion simulation.
   - Write integration tests (e.g., with Testing Library and jest-dom) to assert sections render with/without animation according to motion preferences.
   - Conduct manual a11y review to ensure focus, screen reader, and keyboard navigation are unaffected.
7. **Documentation:**
   - Add code comments explaining variant choices and reduced-motion handling.
   - Document `<AnimatedSection>` usage and patterns in Storybook and/or a short MDX doc file.
