# T016 Plan: Remove/replace disallowed `console.log/warn/error` from component source code

## Task Classification
**Simple**: This task involves scanning component source code for console statements and removing or replacing them.

## Analysis
1. We need to find all instances of `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` in component source code (excluding test files).
2. For each instance found, we need to either:
   - Remove the statement entirely if it's just for debugging
   - Replace it with a structured logging mechanism if it represents necessary operational logging

Since this is a front-end project (Next.js), console statements are typically used for debugging and shouldn't remain in production code. The task mentions structured logging as an alternative, but we should first check if a structured logging system exists in the codebase.

## Implementation Plan
1. Use grep/search tools to find all instances of `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` in the codebase, excluding test files and node_modules
2. Review each instance to determine if it should be removed or replaced
3. Make the necessary changes to eliminate all console statements
4. Verify the changes by running the linter and tests

## Verification Steps
1. After making changes, run a search again to confirm no console statements remain
2. Run the linter to ensure no new issues are introduced: `pnpm lint`
3. Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved: `pnpm test`
4. Run TypeScript compiler to check for type errors: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`
