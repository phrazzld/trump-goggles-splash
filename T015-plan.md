# T015 - Build Features Section Card-Based Layout

## Objective
Implement the Features section with a responsive card-based layout using TexturedCard components and Tailwind grid system.

## Implementation Approach
1. Replace placeholder Features component with full implementation
2. Create responsive grid layout using Tailwind's grid classes
3. Use existing TexturedCard component for each feature
4. Add 3-4 mock features with icons and descriptions
5. Ensure responsive behavior (single column on mobile, multi-column on desktop)

## Layout Structure
- Container with standard spacing and padding
- Grid system: 1 column on mobile, 3 columns on desktop
- Each card contains:
  - Icon (using Lucide React icons)
  - Feature title
  - Feature description
- Proper spacing between cards

## Mock Features
1. "Instant Processing" - Transform the web as you browse
2. "Customizable Filters" - Choose your preferred language style
3. "Privacy Focused" - No data collection, runs locally
4. "Easy Toggle" - Enable/disable with one click

## Responsive Behavior
- Mobile (< sm): Single column layout
- Tablet (sm-md): 2 column layout
- Desktop (lg+): 3 column layout

## Notes
- Follow existing component patterns in the codebase
- Use retro america color scheme and typography
- Apply vintage styling consistent with other components
