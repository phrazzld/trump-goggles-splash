## Chosen Approach

Implement Framer Motion for subtle entrance animations on scroll and load, respect `prefers-reduced-motion`, add more `StarDecoration` elements, and ensure 60fps performance.

## Rationale

- **Simplicity:** Framer Motion is straightforward to integrate with React and Next.js, providing simple APIs for animations.
- **Modularity:** Animations are encapsulated within components, maintaining separation of concerns.
- **Testability:** Framer Motion supports testing with `motion.div` components, and animations can be disabled for easier testing.
- **Coding Standards:** Adheres to project standards with Framer Motion's declarative API.
- **Docs Approach:** Framer Motion has excellent documentation, and our code will include clear comments.

## Build Steps

1. **Install Framer Motion:**
   - Run `npm install framer-motion` or `yarn add framer-motion`.

2. **Configure Framer Motion:**
   - Ensure `AnimatePresence` is used for exit animations if needed.
   - Set up a global configuration to respect `prefers-reduced-motion` by dynamically adjusting animation settings based on user preferences.

3. **Add Entrance Animations to Sections:**
   - Use `motion` variants to define entrance animations for each section (Hero, FeatureShowcase, TrumpismExamples, InstallationGuide, Footer).
   - Ensure animations are triggered on scroll or load using `whileInView` or `useAnimation` hooks with `useInView`.

4. **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`:**
   - Use `useReducedMotion` hook from Framer Motion to conditionally disable animations if the user prefers reduced motion.

5. **Add More StarDecoration Elements:**
   - Strategically place additional `StarDecoration` components throughout sections to enhance the retro Americana theme.

6. **Ensure 60fps Performance:**
   - Optimize animations by using `will-change` and `transform` properties, and avoid animating properties that trigger layout recalculations.
   - Use Framer Motion's `layout` prop for optimized layout animations where applicable.

7. **Testing Approach:**
   - Test animations manually across devices and browsers.
   - Use Framer Motion's test utilities to mock animations and ensure they behave as expected.
