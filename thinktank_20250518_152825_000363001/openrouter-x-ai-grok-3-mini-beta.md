## Chosen Approach
Use a reusable animation wrapper component to apply subtle entrance animations with Framer Motion, respecting user preferences and integrating StarDecoration elements for consistency and performance.

## Rationale
- **Simplicity:** Option 2 provides the simplest solution by centralizing animation logic in a single wrapper, reducing code duplication across sections while avoiding unnecessary complexity compared to scroll-triggered options.
- **Modularity and Strict Separation:** It enforces strict separation by isolating animation concerns in a dedicated wrapper, allowing components to remain focused and independent, outperforming Option 1's scattered approach and Option 3's potential coupling.
- **Testability with Minimal Mocking:** The wrapper enables isolated testing of animation logic without mocking internal collaborators, as required, making it superior to Option 3's harder-to-test scroll interactions and Option 1's basic setup.
- **Coding Standards:** Aligns with standards by using Framer Motion judiciously, ensuring 60fps performance and accessibility, while Option 3 risks over-engineering and Option 1 lacks reusable structure.
- **Documentation Approach:** The wrapper supports self-documenting code and Storybook integration for clear rationale, exceeding Option 1's ad-hoc documentation and Option 3's complex needs.

## Build Steps
1. **Framer Motion Setup:** Install Framer Motion via `npm install framer-motion` and configure in the Next.js project by importing it in a shared module, ensuring `useReducedMotion` hook is globally available for preference checks.
2. **Animation Wrapper Creation:** Develop a reusable `AnimatedSection` component that wraps content with Framer Motion's `motion.div`, defining subtle variants (e.g., fade-in, slide-up) and conditionally disabling animations based on `useReducedMotion`.
3. **Animation Patterns per Section:** Apply `AnimatedSection` to each section (Hero, FeatureShowcase, etc.), customizing variants for subtle effects like opacity fade (0 to 1) over 300ms, and integrate StarDecoration elements with their own motion variants for accent animations.
4. **Scroll Trigger Implementation:** Use Framer Motion's built-in features for load-based triggers, avoiding external libraries to keep it simple; add optional scroll detection via `useInView` for key sections like InstallationGuide, ensuring animations only occur on initial load or view.
5. **Motion Preference and Performance Handling:** In the wrapper, check for `prefers-reduced-motion` and skip animations if detected, while profiling with browser tools to maintain 60fps; add StarDecoration placements strategically in each section's wrapper props for modularity.
6. **StarDecoration Placement Strategy:** Position StarDecoration elements as static accents in sections, animating them subtly (e.g., scale or rotate) via the wrapper, ensuring they enhance without distracting and are performance-optimized.
7. **Testing Approach:** Write unit tests for the wrapper using React Testing Library, covering variants and motion preferences; add E2E tests with Playwright for section animations, ensuring minimal mocking and 90% coverage; manually test for accessibility and performance in Storybook.
