## Chosen Approach
Implement fonts using next/font for optimal performance, configure semantic names in Tailwind, and apply globally through atomic components for a simple, modular overhaul.

## Rationale
- Balances simplicity by leveraging built-in Next.js and Tailwind features, avoiding overengineering while meeting requirements directly.
- Achieves modularity and strict separation by defining fonts as atomic components, aligning with atomic design principles for isolated, reusable units.
- Enhances testability with minimal mocking by structuring code around public APIs, allowing unit tests on components without internal dependencies.
- Adheres to coding standards through strict TypeScript configurations and next/font usage, ensuring type safety, immutability, and no implicit behaviors.
- Follows documentation approach by embedding TSDoc comments in code and updating project README for rationale, focusing on why decisions support maintainability.

## Build Steps
1. Select fonts: Choose Playfair Display Black for display and Inter for body, ensuring bold, retro Americana style and accessibility compliance.
2. Configure fonts: Import Playfair Display Black and Inter using next/font, optimizing for performance with subsets and display=swap to prevent layout shifts.
3. Update Tailwind configuration: Extend tailwind.config.ts with semantic font names, e.g., fontFamily: { display: [var(--font-playfair)], body: [var(--font-inter)] }.
4. Apply typography globally: Create atomic typography components (e.g., in a new TypographyAtoms.ts file) and integrate into layout.tsx for consistent hierarchy across breakpoints.
5. Verify and test: Ensure responsive rendering without shifts by testing on multiple devices, and add unit tests for components to confirm accessibility and performance.
