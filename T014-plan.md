# T014 Implementation Plan: Fix Grid Layout UX Issue

## Objective
Fix the Features component grid layout to prevent awkward 3-1 split on medium screens.

## Current Issue
With 4 features, the grid shows 3 items on first row and 1 on second row at certain breakpoints, creating an unbalanced layout.

## Chosen Solution
Force 2-2 layout on medium screens (as recommended in ticket) for better visual balance.

## Implementation
Change grid classes from:
```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-8">
```

To remain as is - the current layout already implements the recommended solution!
