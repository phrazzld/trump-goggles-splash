## Chosen Approach
Implement entrance animations using Framer Motion with scroll-triggered animations and reduced motion support.

## Rationale
- Follows the simplicity principle by using established libraries (Framer Motion) for animations.
- Maintains modularity by keeping animation logic separate from component logic.
- Ensures testability by using a widely adopted animation library with good testing support.
- Adheres to coding standards by following best practices for animation implementation.
- Aligns with the documentation approach by explaining animation rationale and implementation.

## Build Steps
1. Install Framer Motion: `npm install framer-motion`
2. Create a motion wrapper component for sections that need animations.
3. Implement scroll-triggered animations using Framer Motion's `whileInView` prop.
4. Add `prefers-reduced-motion` support by checking the user's motion preference and adjusting animations accordingly.
5. Enhance sections with additional StarDecoration elements for visual appeal.
6. Test animations for performance (60fps) and accessibility compliance.
7. Document animation implementation and rationale for future reference.
