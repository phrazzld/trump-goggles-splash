# T005: Build FeatureShowcase Section - Implementation Plan

## Task Overview
Create a FeatureShowcase section component that demonstrates how the Trump Goggles extension works through clear before/after comparisons using TexturedCards.

## Requirements
- Create `app/components/sections/FeatureShowcase.tsx`
- Show before/after translation comparisons using TexturedCards
- Clear explanation of how the extension works
- Visual demonstrations that clearly explain functionality

## Implementation Approach

### Component Structure
```typescript
// app/components/sections/FeatureShowcase.tsx
import SectionHeading from '@/app/components/shared/SectionHeading'
import TexturedCard from '@/app/components/shared/TexturedCard'
```

### Key Features
1. Use SectionHeading with h2 level for section title
2. Create before/after comparison cards using TexturedCard
3. Include clear explanatory text about how the extension works
4. Showcase 2-3 translation examples with visual emphasis
5. Maintain retro Americana theme and styling

### Design Decisions
- Layout: Grid or side-by-side comparison layout for translations
- Typography: Use display font for emphasis, body font for explanations
- Visual hierarchy: Clear differentiation between before/after states
- Responsive: Stack cards vertically on mobile, side-by-side on desktop

### Example Structure
```
<section>
  <SectionHeading level={2}>How Trump Goggles Works</SectionHeading>
  <p>Explanation text</p>
  <div className="grid">
    <TexturedCard>Before: ISIS</TexturedCard>
    <TexturedCard>After: Evil Losers</TexturedCard>
  </div>
</section>
```

## Testing Considerations
- Verify TexturedCard import and usage
- Ensure responsive layout works on all breakpoints
- Check accessibility of comparison structure
- Validate semantic HTML structure
