## Chosen Approach
Framer Motion with scroll-triggered animations and motion preference handling, using a unified animation system with staggered section reveals and decorative star flourishes.

## Rationale
- Simplest solution that meets all requirements while maintaining 60fps performance
- Modular animation components that can be reused across sections
- Easy to test with minimal mocking (focus on behavior, not implementation)
- Follows strict TypeScript and Next.js coding standards
- Well-documented approach with clear animation variants

## Build Steps
1. Install Framer Motion: `npm install framer-motion`
2. Create shared animation components:
   - `AnimatedSection` (handles base animation logic)
   - `AnimatedStar` (extends StarDecoration with motion)
3. Implement per-section animations:
   - Hero: Fade-in with slight vertical movement
   - FeatureShowcase: Staggered card reveals on scroll
   - TrumpismExamples: Card flip animations
   - InstallationGuide: Step-by-step sequential reveal
4. Add motion preference handling:
   - Check `window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion)')`
   - Fallback to instant states when reduced motion preferred
5. Optimize performance:
   - Use `will-change` for animated properties
   - Implement `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` for SSR
   - Add intersection observer for scroll triggers
6. Test animations:
   - Visual regression tests for motion states
   - Reduced motion preference simulation
   - Performance profiling
