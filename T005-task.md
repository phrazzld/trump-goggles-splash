## Title
improve star positioning for responsiveness and visibility

## Original Ticket Text
**T005 · Refactor · P0: improve star positioning for responsiveness and visibility**
- **Context:** PLAN.md > Detailed Implementation Plan > Phase 2: Layout Fixes > 2.2 Improve Star Positioning
- **Code Area:** `app/components/shared/AnimatedStar.tsx` (if positioning is internal) or `app/components/Hero.tsx` (if stars are positioned there)
- **Action:**
    1. Replace any existing fixed absolute positioning values for stars with a responsive strategy (e.g., percentages, viewport units, or dynamic calculations based on container size).
    2. Implement "safe zones" or boundary constraints to prevent stars from being clipped or rendering off-screen, especially on smaller viewports.
- **Done‑when:**
    1. Decorative stars are positioned responsively within the hero section.
    2. Stars remain visible and do not clip content or viewport edges on common screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Verification:**
    1. Test star visibility and placement across a range of viewport sizes and aspect ratios (e.g., mobile portrait/landscape, tablet, desktop).
    2. Ensure stars do not overlap critical UI elements.
- **Depends‑on:** none

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

This is a responsive design refactoring task that requires careful analysis of current star positioning and development of a responsive strategy that maintains visual appeal while ensuring visibility across all devices.

Key considerations:
1. **Current State Analysis**: Understand how stars are currently positioned
2. **Responsive Strategy**: Choose between percentage-based, viewport units, or CSS Grid/Flexbox
3. **Safe Zone Implementation**: Prevent stars from clipping on smaller screens
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Maintain the retro Americana aesthetic across devices
5. **Performance Impact**: Ensure responsive positioning doesn't degrade performance
6. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive cross-device testing approach

The approach must follow development philosophy principles of simplicity and maintainability while delivering a robust responsive solution.
