## Chosen Approach
Implement typography overhaul using Playfair Display for headings, Inter for body text, and semantic font configuration in Tailwind CSS.

## Rationale
- Selected Playfair Display as the display font for its elegant, retro aesthetic matching the Americana theme
- Chose Inter as the body font for its clean, modern appearance and optimal readability
- Configured fonts using `next/font` for optimal loading performance
- Implemented semantic font names in `tailwind.config.ts` for consistent typography hierarchy
- Applied typography globally through CSS variables and Tailwind configuration

## Build Steps
1. Configure font loading using `next/font`:
   - Import required fonts (Playfair Display, Inter)
   - Create font instances with appropriate configuration (variable names, subsets, display settings)

2. Update `tailwind.config.ts`:
   - Configure `fontFamily` with semantic names (display, body, accent)
   - Map font families to CSS variables defined by `next/font`

3. Apply global typography styles:
   - Update `globals.css` to use configured font families
   - Define base typography styles for body text and headings
   - Ensure responsive typography using Tailwind's utility classes

4. Verify implementation:
   - Check font rendering across different breakpoints
   - Ensure no layout shifts occur during font loading
   - Test accessibility with proper font sizes and weights

5. Implement type-safe font usage:
   - Use TypeScript to ensure consistent font family references
   - Leverage Tailwind's type-safe configuration for font families
