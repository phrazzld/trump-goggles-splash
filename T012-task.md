# T012 Task

**Task ID:** T012
**Title:** Unit Tests for Shared Components

## Original Ticket Text

- [ ] **T012 · Test · P1: Unit Tests for Shared Components**
    - Test ExternalLink component (security attributes, variants)
    - Test SectionHeading component (semantic tags, props)
    - **Done-when:** 90%+ coverage on shared components
    - **Depends-on:** [T002, T003]

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

As an AI coding agent tasked with implementing this feature, analyze the following requirements and create a comprehensive implementation plan:

### Context
- This is a Trump Goggles Chrome Extension splash page using Next.js 15
- The project follows strict development philosophy with emphasis on simplicity, modularity, and testability
- Components were built following Atomic Design principles
- Current components that need testing: ExternalLink and SectionHeading
- No test framework is currently configured
- In T011 we attempted to set up jest-axe but removed it due to build issues

### Current State
- No test framework configured
- Components are in app/components/shared/
- ExternalLink has text and button variants with security attributes
- SectionHeading creates semantic headings with proper levels
- Project uses TypeScript in strict mode
- pnpm is the package manager (strictly enforced)

### Requirements Analysis
1. Set up appropriate test framework for Next.js 15 project
2. Write comprehensive unit tests for ExternalLink component
3. Write comprehensive unit tests for SectionHeading component
4. Achieve 90%+ code coverage on these components
5. Follow test-first methodology if possible
6. No mocking of internal collaborators
7. Tests must be maintainable and treated as production code

### Technical Considerations
- Next.js 15 compatibility for testing frameworks
- TypeScript support in test framework
- Coverage reporting capability
- Integration with existing ESLint and build pipeline
- Ability to test React components with proper rendering
- Should work with existing Tailwind CSS classes

### Implementation Approach
Create a systematic approach to:
1. Research and select appropriate testing framework
2. Set up test infrastructure and configuration
3. Create test utilities for common patterns
4. Write comprehensive tests for SectionHeading
5. Write comprehensive tests for ExternalLink (both variants)
6. Set up coverage reporting and validate 90%+ coverage
7. Integrate tests into CI pipeline if needed

Consider best practices for React component testing, including:
- Testing public APIs and behavior, not implementation
- Ensuring tests are isolated and repeatable
- Following AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Testing accessibility aspects where relevant
