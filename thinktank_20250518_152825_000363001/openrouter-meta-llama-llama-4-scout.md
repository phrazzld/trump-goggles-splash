## Chosen Approach

Implement entrance animations for a Next.js splash page using Framer Motion, respecting user motion preferences and ensuring smooth animations on scroll/load.

## Rationale

- **Simplicity**: Favor simple, subtle animations that enhance user experience without overwhelming the user.
- **Modularity**: Implement animations as reusable components to maintain consistency across sections.
- **Testability**: Ensure animations are easily testable and integrable with existing components.
- **Coding Standards**: Adhere to established coding standards for React and Framer Motion.
- **Performance**: Optimize animations for 60fps performance.

## Build Steps

1. **Install Framer Motion**: Run `npm install framer-motion` or `yarn add framer-motion`.
2. **Configure Framer Motion**: Wrap the application with `MotionConfig` and set `reducedMotion` to respect user preferences.
3. **Create Animation Variants**: Define animation variants for each section (e.g., Hero, FeatureShowcase, TrumpismExamples, InstallationGuide, Footer).
4. **Implement Animations**: Use `motion.div` and `AnimatePresence` to animate sections on load and scroll.
5. **Add StarDecoration Elements**: Incorporate StarDecoration components throughout sections as accent pieces.
6. **Test Animations**: Verify animations are smooth, respect motion preferences, and meet performance requirements.

## Animation Patterns for Each Section

| Section | Animation Pattern |
|---------|--------------------|
| Hero | Fade in with scale-up effect |
| FeatureShowcase | Slide in from top with staggered delay |
| TrumpismExamples | Fade in with individual item animations |
| InstallationGuide | Slide in from bottom with bounce effect |
| Footer | Fade in with slow opacity transition |

## Scroll Trigger Implementation

- Use `useViewportScroll` from Framer Motion to trigger animations on scroll.
- Implement staggered delays for FeatureShowcase and TrumpismExamples sections.

## Motion Preference Handling

- Wrap the application with `MotionConfig` and set `reducedMotion` to `'user'`.
- Use `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable animations if user prefers reduced motion.

## StarDecoration Placement Strategy

- Add StarDecoration elements in Hero, FeatureShowcase, TrumpismExamples, InstallationGuide, and Footer sections.
- Position StarDecoration elements absolutely with CSS classes.

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize animations for 60fps performance.
- Use `will-change` CSS property to improve animation performance.
- Minimize DOM mutations and layout recalculations.
